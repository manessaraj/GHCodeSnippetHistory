## What changes were proposed in this pull request?
We have seen users getting confused by the documentation for astype and drop_duplicates, because the examples in them do not use these functions (but do uses their aliases). This patch simply removes all examples for these functions, and say that they are aliases.

## How was this patch tested?
Existing PySpark unit tests.

Yay!

As expected, a lot of the stuff in DB class is due to UpdateService
requiring it to process the downloaded indexes and insert data into
the database. Thus, this change is about removing that stuff from
the DB class and migrating to ContentProviders.

This required a bit of a change to the way that UpdateService decides
what to do with the data from indexes, but I hope it will make
understanding and changing UpdateService easier in the long term.
For example, it used to read the app details from database, then
if a repo wasn't updated (due to unchanged index) then it would take
the app details for that repo from the list of apps, and re-update
the database (or something like that).

Now, it has been refactored into the following methods:
 * updateOrInsertApps(appsToUpdate);
 * updateOrInsertApks(apksToUpdate);
 * removeApksFromRepos(disabledRepos);
 * removeApksNoLongerInRepo(appsToUpdate, updatedRepos);
 * removeAppsWithoutApks();
 * and probably some others...
Which hopefully are self-explanitory.

The recent change to implement single repo updates was re-implemented
with in light of the methods above. The interface to UpdateService for
scheduling a single repo update is the same as it was before, but
the implementation is completely different. Still works though.

Using batch content provider operations for repo updates,
but they suffer from the problem of not all being under the same
transaction, so if an insert/update stuffs up half way through, we
are left with only half of the update being complete. In the future,
if there is some way to implement notifications from the content provider's
applyBatch method, then we can do it all in the one transaction, and
still have notifications. Currently we break it into several calls
to applyBatch (and hence several transactions) to inform the user
of the progress.

Also adding the beginnings of some tests for AppProvider. In the future, I'll
work on adding better coverage, including instrumentation to test UI features.

==========================
Below is a list of many of the minor changes that also happened along the way
==========================

Make ""Can update"" tab stay up to date using content observer, rather
than manually deciding when to refresh the tab label as before.

The installed app list is now cached in Utils, because it is invoked
quite a few times, especially when rendering the app lists. The cache is
invalidated when PackageReceiver is notified of new apps.

The content providers don't notify changes if we are in batch mode.
I've left the notification at the end of the batch updates as the
responsibility of the UpdateService. However, it would be nice if this
was somehow handled by the content, as they are really the ones who
should worry about it.

Made curVersion, curVercode and curApk work with providers.
This was done by removing curApk (otherwise we'd need to query the db each
time we fetched one app to get a reference to that apk (resulting in hundreds
of queries). Instead, UpdateService now calculates curVercode and curVersion
and saves them to the database. We then use these where possible. If we really
need curApk (because we want info other than its version and code) we still have
the option of ApkProvider.Helper.find(app.id, app.curVercode). I considered
putting this inside the app value object, e.g. in getCurApk() but thought
better of it as it will likely result in people invoking it all the time,
without realising it causes a DB query.

incompatibleReasons required a minor UI tweak, removing the ""min sdk""
ui element from the Apk list. It is replaced by the ""Requires: %s"" view
(which only appears when the app is incompatible). In the process, and in
response to some feedback from mvdan, I left the min sdk in there, but
only made it show when in ""expert mode"", just like the architecture.

In order to make the ""installed apps"" query work under test conditions,
needed to change the way the InstalledApkCache be replaceable with a
mock object.

Pause UIL loading on fast scroll of list, as the list was very choppy for
some reason.

Re-added ""Last repo scan"" info to the Manage Repo list view.

Fixed up some misc TODO's, removed some unused/empty functions.",ModificationType.MODIFY,,43,3,43,3,f-droid/fdroid-client,fdroid-client,4e561c4070fa25c96e75690db6b0fcb63f69ecb6,.java,15886915,2,https://stackoverflow.com/a/15886915

In the process, also did away with the two `read()` and `write()` methods
that returned a ""readable"" and ""writeable"" database respectively. It turns
out that it doesn't quite do what I originally thought. There is not much
benefit to specifying to the database helper that you want a readable/writeable
database. In fact, it is often the case that a call to `read()` would most
likely have returned the same instance that is returned by `write()`. The
semantics of them were therefore broken, and they've been replaced with
`db()`.",ModificationType.MODIFY,b989ef3eccc2eec2412615bf7bfb9fe8269cfbd9,20,15,4,6,f-droid/fdroid-client,fdroid-client,4e561c4070fa25c96e75690db6b0fcb63f69ecb6,.java,15886915,2,https://stackoverflow.com/a/15886915

 The event system has been revamped to carry more payload data (and in an extensible form as dictionary, to allow for later addition of attributes to single events), with the existing event listeners adjusted to also allow users to make use of this data in their consumers.

This adds the ability for themes to add support for videos in custom headers
by passing `'video' => true` as an argument when adding theme support for
custom headers.

Custom video headers are managed through the “Header Visuals” (i.e. “Header Image”)
panel in the Customizer where you can select a video from the media library or set a
URL to an external video (YouTube for now) for use in custom headers.

This introduces several new functions:

`has_header_video()` – Check whether a header video is set or not.
`get_header_video_url()` – Retrieve header video URL for custom header.
`the_header_video_url()` – Display header video URL.
`get_header_video_settings()` – Retrieve header video settings.
`has_custom_header()` – Check whether a custom header is set or not.
`get_custom_header_markup()` – Retrieve the markup for a custom header.
`the_custom_header_markup()` – Print the markup for a custom header.

And a new file, `wp-includes/js/wp-custom-header.js` that handles loading videos
in custom headers.

This also enables video headers in the Twenty Seventeen and Twenty Fourteen themes.

In [38985], we used jQuery to trigger a custom event once a video
handler has completed so themes, like Twenty Fourteen, can execute
their own adjustments after the header video has loaded.

This replaces the jQuery `trigger()` method with a native event and
updates Twenty Fourteen accordingly.

This adds play/pause controls to video headers, along with voice
assistance, using `wp.a11y.speak`, to make custom video headers more
accessible. To make styling the play/pause button easier for themes,
CSS has been omitted from the default implementation.

This also includes a refactor of the `wp.customHeader` code to introduce
a `BaseHandler` class, which can be extended by plugins and themes to modify
or enhance the default video handlers.

This works by defining two 'static' lists in hack. The first is the list
of all flags in the project which use a `-` or an `_` in their name. All
files being processed by verify-flags-underscore.py (or all files in the
repo if no filename arguments are given) will be searched for flag
declaration using a simple regex. Its not super smart. If a flag is
found which is not in the static list it will complain/reject the commit
until a human adds it to the list. If we do not keep a static list of
flags it takes >.2 seconds to find them 'all' at runtime. Since this is
run in pre-commit saving every part of a second helps.

After it finds all of the flags it runs all of the arguments (or all
files in repo if no arguments) looking for usage of those flags which
includes an `_`. There are lots of places where these are false
positives. For example we have a flag named oom-adj-score but the kernel
calls it oom_adj_score. To handle this we keep a second 'whitelist' of
lines which are allowed to use these flag names with an `_`.

Running the entire git repo looking for flags in every golang file and
looking in every single file for bad usage takes about 8.75 seconds.

takes about .06 seconds.",ModificationType.ADD,,213,0,213,0,fabioy/kubernetes,kubernetes,6839f643a0d0008f45bf881ae7f3f58b7b6b6052,.py,898669,1,https://stackoverflow.com/q/898669
